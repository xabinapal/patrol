## How to Report Security Issues

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect Patrol users. Please use one of the following methods:

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended)

Report the vulnerability through GitHub's private security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](../../security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with details

### Option 2: Email

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, please email security issues to:

**[MAINTAINER EMAIL - TO BE CONFIGURED]**

Please include "Patrol Security" in the subject line.

- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal PoC (without exploiting production systems)
